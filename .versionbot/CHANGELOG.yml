      body: |
        This was being passed to the `cargo_finalize` job as
        `CARGO_REGISTRY_DEFAULT` but that is the wrong way to set alternate
        registries. That variable is a valid configuration but it must not point
        to an URL, it must point to a registry name configured in Cargo.toml. In
        fact, all the registry configuration may be configured via Cargo.toml,
        making the variable a redundant interface.

      body: |
        No workflows are using this input, and instead we use the
        automatic GITHUB_TOKEN with a custom permissions block in the
        calling workflow.

        This removes 5 instances of token generation that was otherwise
        unused.

        the extra SHA tag without the build- prefix was redundant and we want
        to encourage the use of the tags with build- prefix only.

      body: |
        Tag push events are only somewhat supported, and there
        is no situation where this ever would have worked since
        we need to look at the PR body and commits to generate notes.

        The previous function was throwing errors in some cases
        when the gh cli expected a local .git directory.

        Instead we should avoid an interactive CLI for steps like this.

      hash: eb9fa414309e521fb524fbffaa4003e12d2ef87b
      body: |
        We still support push events for some projects
        but file list has been broken for a while because
        pull_request does not exist on the event context so
        node aborts.

        Instead use the actions || condition that handles
        all failures of the first condition.

    - subject: Add support for CloudFormation templates as files
      hash: 3f97ae96358b719677d76be2f638b074431e61cd
      body: >
        CloudFormation templates as inputs are difficult to manage

        due to their size, and being embedded in another yaml file.


        This change allows moving CloudFormation templates to their own

        file template in the root of the project where they can be
        autodiscovered

        by Flowzone and deployed.


        It also allows us to modify CF templates on repositories that otherwise

        have push restrictions applied to the .github directories.

      body: |
        The existing behaviour prevents using flowzone with
        user or repository app installations, and only works with orgs.

        This change keeps orgs as the default, but allows other
        installation types to use flowzone with app installations
        which is the preferred secure approach.

    - subject: Add check for legacy branch protection
      hash: f6a32edc112fed17d65ef95c882808e700b5adc7
      body: |
        This will allow us to detect classic branch protection
        rules that would otherwise break versioning on merge.

        Unfortunately it requires admin:read to check for existing
        classic protection rules, but it's better than admin:write
        and it's only temporary until we are confident all legacy rules
        are gone and/or versioning is moved out of Flowzone.

        Now that we are using rulesets across all orgs we can add
        the Flowzone GitHub App to the ruleset exceptions and no
        longer require admin permissions to push directly to main branches.

      hash: cedd235571f55fb7579839e52b7db16e8937cfb3
      body: |
        The last change to the labels metadata broke conditions
        when there was a tag prefix or suffixand we were expecting
        to test "sut:latest" via the compose file.

        We were only creating local tags with the format "sut:prefix-latest"
        or "sut:latest-suffix" so docker compose couldn't find the expected
        "sut:latest" tag and would rebuild, possibly with the wrong targets.

        These two steps were largely redundant anyway, and the latter was only

        used to populate a list of possible image cache sources as fallback if
        gha

        doesn't have a current cache.


        Rather than run two metadata steps, just run it once with all possible

        image tag combinations.

        ARMv6 builds may hang when building on ARMv8 hardware due to emulated
        CP15 builds. This configures the runner kernel to use hardware execution
        rather than emulation to avoid the issue.

        notes so we can change the default checkout depth

        Using the github ref is not appropriate for pull_request_target

        Same with the Node version checks, no need on close events.

        The octoscan checks should run on merge to update the main
        branch code scanning results, but not on PR close.

      body: |
        The octoscan commit that added this check was clear
        that it needs some improved regex.

        As it stands it will flag any writes to GITHUB_ENV
        or GITHUB_OUTPUT whether they are being used
        unsafely in a following step or not.

        For now let's disable it to get past all the noise
        until octoscan can correctly identify improper usage.

        The security-events permission is not granted by the restricted

        The codeql-action/upload-sarif action using internal endpoints
        and does not work with app installation tokens so here we use
        the github-script action to upload the SARIF file to GitHub via
        the REST API.

      body: |
        Use the GitHub API to check commit parents in BASE and HEAD
        branches and ensure we are following a linear history.

        HEAD should not have any merge commits, so reject any HEAD branches
        where one or more commits have multiple parents.

        The PR merge commit must include the HEAD commit as a parent,
        otherwise reject the versioning job.

    - subject: Use App Installation tokens where read-only is not sufficient
      hash: acf32e820c9751dd4465d10db2637497473ec1de
      body: |
        In order to use the default read-only policy for the automatic
        GITHUB_TOKEN, we need have Flowzone prefer App Installation tokens
        in many cases where write access is required.

        The exceptions being OIDC and packages as these are currently
        only accessible via the automatic token and nothing else.

        This allows us to fail the step as expected if an App ID is provided
        but we are unable to generate a token. Otherwise it is very hard to
        find the issue in the logs.

        Posting a comment to a PR does not require the elevated
        access of the flowzone-app[bot] so we can just go back
        to using the automatic github token with hardcoded permissions
        as we were before.

        The existing method of using labels allows for
        Actions Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) attacks
        because we do not associate the label with any commit.

        This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
        comment generated for each workflow run.

      body: |
        The sha based dist-tag is minimally useful as you can install the
        version directly since the sha based dist-tag will be unique to a
        specific version anyway whereas the branch based dist-tag can be used
        as a floating tag to automatically follow the latest build of the
        branch if desired

        This prevents merging PRs that do not have any required

        checks, in theory. In practice the rules may not contain

        required status checks but the presence of any branch rule is good
        enough.

      hash: 44005f1c397861bf10de8dfcfa96b86e196e29f7
      body: >
        The git -c option sets a configuration value for a single Git command
        invocation.

        It does not modify any configuration files or persist the setting beyond
        this specific command.


        This approach ensures that the authentication credentials are used
        securely for this

        specific operation without risk of unintended persistence or exposure in
        configuration files.

        Apparently there is also this variant:

        ```
          Function:
            Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
            Properties:
              Code:
                ImageUri: !Ref EcrRepositoryUri
                ...
        ```

        To handle it, let jq return a null without erroring back to the shell
        and let the for loop handle empties.

        (1) point to a directory to be packaged manually

                  ...

        This pach should handle both cases (currently it only handles 1).

      hash: de553b7c4f9fa7beaadfc8b203b60a7fd73f5320
      body: >
        There needs to be an additional step when packaging CFN tempates

        containing Lambda/Code: reference directory. By default, without

        using a completely different CFN "SAML" workflow (we don't want to

        go there maybe yet), dependencies need to be installed into the

        same directory as the Lamda code.


        This comit implements this workflow for Python code when
        requirements.txt

        is present.

        Reducing fetch depth saves a lot of time on the checkout
        step present in most jobs, so every little bit helps.

      body: |
        Increase cache from min to max, and remove the branch
        name from the cache scope.

        Max mode will cache all layers, including intermediate stages.

        This is a minor change as some repositories may run out
        of cache space when building for many platforms.

        This ensures that the build will use the exact dependencies in
        Cargo.lock and fail if Cargo.lock has not been updated.

        This is a stricter option which will could potentially cause previously
        working builds to fail, but it is necessary to allow for better
        reproducibility of builds.

    - subject: Prepare PR release message in separate job
      hash: ccd9d870e28eadd5e34c3289f460aa35cc4848cd
      body: |
        The work on PR #1046 made the finalize github release job dependent
        on the `release_notes` input. That's a regression on the correct
        behavior. This PR moves the PR comment and deploy message to a separate
        job that is dependent on the input, and makes the release_notes job run
        on every PR, which allows the github finalize job to always run on
        merge.

        This is a major change because it changes the way the release_notes
        input work, even though it restores the right behavior.

        We've seen cases where the checkout ref was undefined because

        in the github context json.

        Without this change, the checkout would continue but quietly
        fallback to the ref or sha for the event with unexpected results.

        With this change, the checkout will fail so we can fix the workflow.

      body: |
        Historically we have used the PR merge commit, which is the GitHub
        default, to ensure that we are testing the same merges that will
        be committed to the target branch.

        However, we already require that branches be rebased on the
        target before merging via branch protections so there is no benefit
        gained from using the merge commit.

        We also would like to enable use cases where we are testing against
        old versions of the target branch and not include changes from the tip
        of the target.

        to parse renovate PRs in a different way as regular PRs. With renovate
        PRs, the job will look for a `### Release Notes` in the Renovate PR body
        and create a comment that the user can edit to provide the release body.

        With regular PRs, the job will look for a `## Release notes` section to
        use as the release notes body.

    - subject: Increase default max parallel matrix jobs to 20
      hash: b79abb66aaea371f43bed8998d604846cb3c4c3d
      body: |
        According to the team at Actuated, and observed in
        our job queue, setting a max parallel matrix value
        DOES NOT prevent a runner from being assigned to the
        job. It takes the runner but is prevented from executing
        the steps if the max value is reached.

        So for now we will set the default max parallel jobs
        to the same global 20 concurrent max in our Actuated plan.

        This will prevent jobs from taking a runner slot only
        to be stopped from execution by the GH max parallel setting.

      body: |
        Without this dependency, we were cloning the default
        sha in the checkoutVersionedSha sha step. It was a coincidence
        that this worked for internal PRs.

        It became obvious when I saw the step in the workflow reported
        as "Checkout" instead of "Checkout abc123..."

    - subject: Pass the build target when invoking clippy
      hash: 55ed9e7e1f690cf8bf4473741f485755f53f296f
      body: |
        The motivation for this change was to allow us to properly request the C
        Runtime (CRT) to be statically linked.

        In summary, each target defaults to either static or dynamic CRT
        linking, but we can request static linking regardless of defaults by
        using the `crt-static` target feature. The usual way to achieve that is
        setting the `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static"` environment
        variable. (See
        https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes)

        Rust projects using Flowzone can already do that by using `cross` for
        building and setting the environment variable in a `Cross.toml` file
        (see
        https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/blob/main/docs/environment_variables.md#environment-variable-passthrough).

        So far so good. The problem is, the `--target` option is required when
        using `crt-static`, and Flowzone was not passing it to `cargo clippy`.
        (See
        https://msfjarvis.dev/posts/building-static-rust-binaries-for-linux/ for
        an overview of the issue, and
        https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78210#issuecomment-714776007
        for some more specific details.)

        These versions have been EOL for a significant period and continuing to

        We've seen cases where the KVM device is not found
        on ubuntu-22.04 runners, so continue on error for now.

        Failed to open the device 'kvm': No such file or directory

      hash: aabfe5cc48af47c41ed7536348dcc58a2e8f20a8
      body: |
        The `custom_runs_on` array supports multiple runner labels
        in nested arrays.

        The new input also allows the use of self-hosted runners
        as they require multiple labels to identify.

        This reverts a previous move to tar.zst. While zstd provides better
        compression, tar.gz is a more commonly used format and is compatible
        accross multiple platforms

        This is a major change as it changes the expected output from an
        existing process.

      body: |
        Without the --admin flag there should be no chance of
        accidentally bypassing branch protection rules.

        This allows us to use GitHub rulesets instead of branch
        protection and Flowzone doesn't need admin:read to verify
        if there are rules in place.

        See: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_merge

      hash: f90ec2144cf1bd7dbf15f006ee9050bf3e968ddb
      body: >
        Allowing Flowzone to make repo configuration changes

        via administrator tokens effectively grants any user with

        write permissions the ability to make admin changes.


        Repo configuration should be handled outside of the CI

        context where administrator permissions can be granted to

        a central authority only.


        This is a breaking change for repos that previously opted into these
        settings.

        This workflow will not run unless the calling workflow omits the related
        inputs.

        This avoids matching substrings of the natively supported platforms
        by converting the list to json first.

      hash: 42ce12f108c98af66b7f22283614f8bc11545f59
      body: |
        When running binfmt in a guest docker daemon on arm64 the
        native support for arm/v6 and arm/v7 is not reflected.

        However buildx detects support for those platforms just fine.

        These were always a security concern and now there
        appears to be no requirement for them.

        The workaround for providing GitHub tokens to compose
        tests is to encode a PAT as part of COMPOSE_VARS which
        are only injected for private repositories.

      hash: ff47650c13f8acacb234e6e150dde311c98e1954
      body: |
        PRs from forks are using workflows from the target
        branch via pull_request_target, or they have had the .github
        branch reset before running custom actions.

        So this restriction is no longer required.

      body: |
        The github.sha value is the tip of BASE for external PRs,
        and the merge commit for internal PRs so it is ideal
        from a security standpoint to run custom actions.

    - subject: Use `docker compose run` for testing
      hash: 86aacf185acadf47b667047849a5c4a9d57ef913
      body: >
        From docker compose documentation:


        > The `docker compose run` command is for running "one-off" or "adhoc"
        tasks. It requires the service name you want to run and only starts
        containers for services that the running service depends on. Use run to
        run tests or perform an administrative task such as removing or adding
        data to a data volume container. The `run` command acts like `docker run
        -ti` in that it opens an interactive terminal to the container and
        returns an exit status matching the exit status of the process in the
        container.


        Using `docker compose up` may lead to a false negative test if one of

        the other services (i.e. not the `sut` service), terminate before the

        service gets a chance to finish.

      body: |
        The docker compose tests are one of the few places
        where we are providing elevated secrets to untrusted user
        code beyond the workflow itself.

        In the case of a GitHub token appended to compose vars,
        we should use the automatic GHA token if possible and avoid
        leaking a privileged PAT or ephemeral app token, even when restricted
        to internal PRs.

        This will raise awareness of the issue as workflow errors
        in the workflow summary are often never seen.

        The workaround is usually to create a repo.yml with the
        project type to satisfy versionist.

        Alternatively, we could look into improving the versionist
        project type assumptions.

      hash: 4c3678755a7307bf18de1515fd53b1b13f6c4de4
      body: |
        For open pull requests, the versioned commit and tag
        objects are created but are intentionally not referenced
        anywhere in the git tree.

        As such, command line tools like git describe do not return
        the current versioned tag which is sometimes used in build scripts.

        So before build, test, and publish jobs we can create the references
        to the orphaned objects locally. These references should already
        exist on merge/finalize.

        This also removes the need for versioned source artifacts
        as each job can clone the versioned commit directly.

    - subject: Make pseudo-tty allocation optional.
      hash: 03b7b78659a70312c68c14c540e2c08e88d601cf
      body: |
        Pseudo-tty allocation uses the `script` command for setting up the
        environment, however this really only works in linux runners, meaning
        users trying to setup runs on other environments will see their tests
        fail for unrelated reasons. This makes the configuration optional
        behind a `pseudo_terminal` input.

      hash: d628d5cb91cc792c380366761427b414dab7be29
      body: |
        The `script` command used for pseudo-tty during testing writes to
        `typescript` in the current directory by default. This may cause issues
        with some projects that do not expect new files to be generated. This
        changes the location of that file to the `/tmp` directory to avoid any
        issues.

      body: >
        This wraps the shell in the steps that run `npm run test`

        and `poetry run pytest` in a `script -q -e -c` to allow tests that

        require pseudo-tty (e.g. for applications that work with terminal
        colors)

        to be able to operate as they would in a local dev environment.

        This is a cleanup of the logic to determine which
        GH token to provide in different situations.

        In all cases we should use the GH app token, or the
        FLOWZONE_TOKEN, except for user code.

        By making e2e tests a manual step we can speed up Flowzone
        development and reduce noise on production repositories.

        The downside being the default tests could miss things
        but it's rare that things fail in e2e and pass in Flowzone self-tests.

        Since we don't rely on Protect Branch as a required check
        anymore it actually saves time to run it early in the workflow,
        before jobs like All Tests and All Jobs have queued.

        The max size is 10GB before it starts recycling old data.

        If this is a problem for some repos they can set a custom
        "cache-to" value in their docker-bake file and it will
        be used instead.

        Also remove any groups called "default" to avoid

        This is the first of a set of commits
        to refactor large jobs into smaller components.

        This will allow more control over dependencies
        while speeding up runtime since more jobs
        can run in parallel.

        Clippy needs to install repository dependencies before running. These

        dependencies may sometimes require external packages, which are provided

        by `cross` [pre-build
        hook](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross#pre-build-hook) feature.


        This PR changes the rust steps order so clippy is run using cross

        instead of default cargo.

        The test workflow will identify whether the PR is from a fork or not

        and we conditionally run either `pull_request` or `pull_request_target`

        events and skip the other to avoid duplicate workflows.


        Modifications to workflow files will be ignored for
        `pull_request_target`

        events by GitHub so we just need to make sure we aren't sharing secrets

        to arbitrary code.

        The `github_finalize` job was trying to use the original source of the

        for creating the release notes. This required the source artifact to

        exist at the moment of merge which is not always true as merge can

        happen at any point after creating the PR. This changes the job to use

        the latest source but exclude the last two commits (merge and version)

        from the release notes.

      body: >
        This may extend to more valid uses than intended, but for now we need

        to prevent merging PRs that have had master merged into them. This
        scenario

        will break versioning in master.


        The intended workflow at balena has always been to rebase PRs, so we
        have

        to continue to force this for now and avoid breaking merges.

      body: |
        This fixes a few bugs in those language jobs
        that were preventing the post-merge run from terminating successfully.

        - `github_finalize` was missing a step to download the sources
        - `cargo_publish` was wrongly failing if `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` was
          empty
        - `npm_finalize` was failing because the test package publishing was
          conflicting with the flowzone package publish.

        This commit also adds a new github clean job, to remove any draft
        releases left behind after a PR is closed without merging.

      body: |
        Since compose yaml files are often used for balena deployments,
        and optionally for docker compose tests, let's avoid overloading
        the file further and ignore it when looking for bake files.

        This should avoid a confusing mess of services to build when
        both compose files and bake files are present in a repo.

        Bake files used for docker build and deploy.
        Compose files used for docker compose tests and balena deploy.

        This avoids issues where a PR is 1 version behind master (eg another PR
        was recently merged) and then the updated version for the PR branch
        will match the master version and give a false positive about "Failed
        to detect any versioned files"

      hash: e5e823e753b1ca5620d565c1525ec7e2f70c4a25
      body: |
        This commit replaces the Docker platform build/test matrix
        with a single docker-compose test. It also allows multiple bake
        targets for publishing image variants with unique tags.

        Currently only the linux/amd64 platform image will be tested
        with compose tests but any targets defined in the bake file(s)
        will be published as defined.

        The same cache scope is used for the compose tests as the publish
        steps so targets with long build times should need to build once.
        Additional cache sources can be added to the bake file(s).

        This input was very easy to break with formatting issues
        and did not take into account the fact that Flowzone job
        names may change.
        A suitable replacement should be considered to adjust the existing
        branch rules rather than apply all new ones.
